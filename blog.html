              <p>Finally, Angular v14 is here! The Angular community launched the all-new Angular 14 on 02 June 2022.
                  From going to 100% Ivy in the former release of Angular 13 to the addition of new primitives in the
                  Angular Component dev kit (CDK), this is how the advancements get introduced with the release of
                  Angular 14.
               </p>

               <p>
                  This release also includes many features and bug fixes that are contributed directly by the
                  community members. Removal of IE11 support, typescript version update to 4.4, changes in the Angular
                  Package Format, were some of the notable changes in the Angular 13 version. Let's see what Angular
                  14 has to offer!</p>

                  <h3>1. Angular gets simplified with Standalone Components</h3>
              <p>This is one of the major advancements that can be seen with the release of Angular 14. With the
                  addition of standalone components, the process of writing Angular Apps becomes much simpler and
                  easier than before. </p>

              <h3>2. Typed Forms </h3>
              <p>When it comes to Angular, there are two distinctive approaches for handling the forms. They can be
                  either created by the template-driven approach or by using the reactive approach.

                  This newly introduced feature of Typed Forms is only applicable to reactive forms. The values inside
                  form controls, groups, and arrays are type safe. It improves the overall “ type” safety of the
                  applications developed using Angular. </p>

              <h3>3. Streamlined Page Title accessibility </h3>
              <p>While developing apps your page title distinctively represents the content of your page. In the
                  previous release of Angular 13, the process of adding title was streamlined with the new
                  Route.title property in the Angular Router.

                  Now with Angular 14, there are no more additional imports required when adding a title to your page.
              </p>

              <h3>4. New primitives in the Angular CDK</h3>
              <p>The Component Dev Kit (CDK) from Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating Angular
                  components. The CDK Menu and Dialog have now been promoted to stable version in Angular 14!

                  The addition of new CDK primitives in Angular 14 allows for the creation of more accessible custom
                  components. </p>
